# mystical-spellcrafting-apparatus
I always wanted to make some kind of program that lets me make magical spells, combine effects without too many limitations, and even do cool stuff with it. It's also so I can test out some more Java stuff, like getting data from json and whatnot.

Currently, this project is very on and off, meaning I probably won't be adding much to the project due to how busy life situations are. Thank you for your patience.
